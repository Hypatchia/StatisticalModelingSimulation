### **KDE Univariate: Kernel Density Estimation.** 
- KDE is a powerful technique used for estimating the probability density function of a continuous random variable.
This part focuses on Kernel Density Estimation for univariate data.

### **KDE Multivariate: Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation.**
- In this section, you'll find my implementations and examples in R, helping understand and utilize KDE for multivariate data.


### **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**

- Kaplan-Meier estimation is a Survival Analysis Tool.It is a non-parametric method for estimating the survival function from lifetime data.
The code is in Python. 

### **Probability Distributions Implementation**

- This section includes implementations of various probability distributions in Python Probability distributions are fundamental in statistics and data analysis. 
This part of the repository provides code to work with common probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, exponential distribution, and more.

### **Probability Distributions Simulation**

- This provides Examples for simulating data from probability distributions. This is a valuable resource for conducting Random Sampling Simulations and generating synthetic data for testing statistical methods.

### **Stochastic Processes ImplementationSimularion**
- Stochastic processes are used to model random phenomena that evolve over time. This part of the repository provides implementations and Simulation in Python for various stochastic processes.
